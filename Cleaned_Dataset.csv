CitraNOX®,Unknown,CitraNOX® is a unique formula designed to maintain healthy blood pressure levels already within the normal range by enhancing nitric oxide synthesis.,"The aging process, an overconsumption of high glycemic load foods, stress, physical inactivity and toxic burden can all wreak havoc on endothelial cells by disrupting inflammatory balance. This disruption can lead to arterial rigidity and vasoconstriction, due to a decrease in circulating nitric oxide (NO) levels. NO is a potent vasodilator and cell signaling molecule. NO is produced with the help of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) during the recycling of L-arginine to L-citrulline in the urea cycle. NO diffuses into the smooth muscle cells lining arteries and initiates a cascade of phosphorylation reactions resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation of the artery. Using a combination of high-dose L-citrulline, quercetin and grape seed extract, CitraNOX® delivers full-spectrum support to help maintain healthy inflammatory balance, arterial elasticity, optimal nitric oxide levels and blood flow. Recent research shows that when compared to L-arginine, supplemental L-citrulline maintains peak plasma NO levels for twice the length of time, resulting in normal blood flow. Quercetin is a well-known flavonoid shown to inhibit ICAM-1 and NFkB, allowing for a normal inflammatory balance.

hyperimmune sensitivity and seasonal discomfort. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is 
an amino acid precursor to one of the most important antioxidants in the body, 
glutathione. Both glutathione and NAC help reduce the viscosity of mucus, 
allowing for cleared airways and improved respiratory health. Vitamin C cannot 
be synthesized by humans and is therefore an essential nutrient that must be

metabolites to support estrogen balance and breast and prostate health. Estrogen 
collectively refers to female hormones that carry chemical messages to cells

divide and multiply.” It is for this reason that hormones are so important in human 
development and tissue repair. Supporting proper estrogen synthesis, metabolism 
and detoxification is essential for proper hormonal balance. I3C helps achieve 
this goal through its ability to temper estrogen signals by competing for binding 
sites and inhibiting the activity of estrogen receptors. The second phytonutrient 
compound, DIM, promotes beneficial estrogen metabolism and enhances the 
potential for greater antioxidant activity. Together, I3C and DIM promote the 
creation of the more favorable and protective 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE) metabolite 
versus production of 4-hydroxyestrone (4-OHE) and 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone

boost butyrate production, and increase GLP-1 production. Solnul® resistant potato starch further enhances gut health by 
increasing microbiome diversity and significantly increasing Akkermansia muciniphila levels—up to 238% in clinical studies—
 thereby promoting metabolic health and GLP-1 production. This increase in GLP-1 production and release plays a role in 
regulating cravings, satiety and maintaining balanced blood sugar, contributing to a more favorable metabolic profile. Baobab 
fruit powder extract provides additional fiber plus essential vitamins, minerals, polyphenols and amino acids. These nutrients 
support microbiome diversity and immune resilience and help maintain normal inflammatory balance.The slow fermentation of these key ingredients minimizes GI discomfort, making Fiber MGP ideal for patients seeking 
effective, gentle digestive support. By combining high fiber content with targeted prebiotics and nutrient-dense baobab, 
Fiber MGP offers a multimodal approach to gut health that addresses regularity, microbiome balance and metabolic benefits 
without the common side effects of fiber supplementation.","GASTROINTESTINAL

following the USDA ""My Plate"" recommendations.","The USDA's ""MyPlate"" program recommends that adult men and women load up 50% 
of their dinner plate with fruits and vegetables. Sadly, more than half of Americans are 
not consuming this amount on a daily basis. While most Americans know that fruits and 
vegetables are packed with nutrients, antioxidants and polyphenols that have been 
shown to have a positive impact on overall health, it can be difficult to comply with the 
current recommendations  with hectic schedules and modern conveniences such as fast 
food. Indigo Greens® provides a blend of organic fruits  and greens paired with a wide 
variety of organic vegetable powders to help bridge the gap in the typical American diet.  
Indigo Greens® can be taken as a standalone beverage mixed in juice or water, or used in 
a comprehensive fruit and vegetable smoothie to give an added boost of phytonutrients 
from organic fruits and vegetables. Children and adults alike are sure to enjoy and benefit 
from Indigo Greens® in their daily regime. Indigo Greens® is FODMAP-friendly and uses only

  Bacillus species use quorum sensing to group together, communicate, and produce active compounds that deter unwanted organisms. This intelligent networking triggers the production of 
 key enzymes that inhibit the growth of undesirable bacteria.
  Immunoglobulin Protection
  The result of Bacillus species inhibiting the growth of undesirable bacteria is ultimately bacterial breakdown, which can expose the gut to toxic compounds. That is why it is important to use 
 concentrated immunoglobulins, which have broad-spectrum capacity to bind toxins and cell components released when bacteria are broken down. This neutralizes and protects the GI tract

ORTHOMEGA CAPSULES 820,Unknown,Unknown,"Orthomega® 820 is a high-concentration fish oil sourced from waters off the Chilean coast. As the world’s least-industrialized coastline, these cold, fresh waters provide the cleanest, most sustainable source of fish in the world. Orthomega® provides 820 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per soft gel as triglycerides, the preferred form with superior absorption. The human body is accustomed to digesting and absorbing EPA and DHA in the triglyceride form. Despite this, the majority of fish oil products available on the market are in the ethyl ester form. The unusual structure of ethyl esters is resistant to the digestive enzymes that enable fat breakdown. The triglyceride form found in Orthomega® 820 allows for enhanced absorption and better assimilation in the body. To stabilize the oil, vitamin E (as mixed tocopherols) and rosemary extract are used to ensure maximum purity and freshness. This exclusive fish oil is purified, vacuum-distilled and independently tested to ensure heavy metals, pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are removed to undetectable levels. While most of the studies over the past three decades have focused on EPA and DHA, in recent years, there has been a growing interest in the omega-3 intermediate compound docosapentaenoic acid (DPA). Research has shown DPA collects in a variety of tissues, including the liver, breasts, brain, eyes, heart and red blood cells. DPA is the intermediate from EPA to DHA, and combined with the retroconversion of DHA to EPA, is now being considered an important reservoir for both EPA and DHA. Based on this growing body of research, each Orthomega® 820 soft gel contains 50 mg of DPA","ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS, CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH

OsteoBase,Unknown,"OsteoBase provides targeted doses of magnesium, vitamin K, vitamin D, and calcium critical to maintaining foundational bone health.","Conclusive research has shown bone tissue requires key nutrients to establish peak bone mass and maintain healthy bone density. OsteoBase provides 300 mg of calcium (150 mg in the form of hydroxyapatite) and 300 mg of magnesium per serving, in a 1:1 ratio. Calcium is most well-known for its role in the formation of bone and teeth, but it also plays a role in keeping the heart and muscles functioning by governing muscle contractions. Research indicates that up to 50% of the population is deficient in magnesium. Magnesium is also a constituent of bone and controls potassium and calcium uptake, assists in electrical nerve activity, and manages the metabolism of carbohydrates. Magnesium is required to activate vitamin D, and plays a key role in the architecture and strength of the hydroxyapatite crystals in bone's matrix. Magnesium enhances the absorption of calcium, and works in tandem with calcium to allow muscles to contract and relax. Combined, these two essential minerals maintain an intricately linked relationship that supports both muscle and nervous system function. Vitamin K2 (MK-7) as MenaQ7®PRO helps to bind newly absorbed calcium to the mineral matrix in bone through its activation of the protein osteocalcin. In addition, vitamin K has been found to help maintain bone mineral density by decreasing the activity of osteoclasts, or cells that break down the bone matrix. In this way, vitamin K and vitamin D not only share similar qualities, but also act in synergy within the body. This formulation includes 45 mcg of vitamin K2 and 25mcg (1,000 IU) of vitamin D3 per serving, for optimal absorption and use by the body.",MUSCULOSKELETAL HEALTH,Unknown,https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1IJa7W-vXPdZV9wISbxnGIdxPLlmgGglc,https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1JTRk_xKXPRmAfkVcPDjNKXHJfSXLGoj0,https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=17OgFjDF6gEzP8dUHD_rTkhjiQBhhoW6e,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,https://drive.google.com/file/d/17aT6hgZQOPLEiGmu4E_XD8cx5xa4PLRP/view,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

OsteoPrev also includes vitamins D and K and phytonutrients to help support bone health and maintenance. Bone mineral density (BMD) is a major determinant of bone mass and is the most common measurement of the quality of bone. Consuming a healthy diet and ensuring optimal levels of bone-building vitamins and minerals are key strategies for preserving bone strength. BMD is determined by a lifelong process called bone remodeling. Bone remodeling occurs when bone tissue is removed from the skeleton (bone reabsorption) and new bone tissue is formed. While calcium is an effective starting point for promoting bone health, other nutrients are required for bone mineralization. Nutrients, such as magnesium, boron, vitamin K and D and trace minerals, significantly enhance the bone mineralization process. OsteoPrev provides full-spectrum nutrition to optimize the bone mineralization process and help maintain bone mineral density.","MUSCULOSKELETAL HEALTH, WOMEN'S HEALTH",Unknown,https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Q_TBC3DJMEoEIBEamQMKIusxaMklZon9,https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=13gFM4BNGAgIPqdQkZjl6GVKjWg8Q5tee,https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1KVsS6jBsg18O0K-ZjMdXse6z_iXg6Mk0,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,https://drive.google.com/file/d/17aT6hgZQOPLEiGmu4E_XD8cx5xa4PLRP/view,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown
